# 🚧 Lynchburg Road Issues 🚧

➡️ [CLICK HERE TO VIEW AND ADD ISSUES](https://github.com/Lynchburg-Urban-Network/lynchburg-road-issues/issues)

This tracker is for issues with the existing sidewalk network, cycling network, and roads in Lynchburg, Virginia, USA. It is also a place for new ideas that would make the transportation networks in the city safer, more beautiful, and more efficient.

This tracker is inspired by Mateusz Konieczny's [Krakow Road Issues](https://github.com/matkoniecz/Krakow/issues) (private repo) project as well as an intention stated by the former Lynchburg City manager Bonnie Svrcek to create a [sidewalk project rating system](https://wset.com/news/local/lynchburg-to-create-sidewalk-rating-system-for-city-residents).

## Rules for issue contribution
* Use precise language to describe what is wrong or exactly what you would like to see changed
* Provide pictures or street-view screenshots of the area if possible
* Provide a link to the area on OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, etc.
* Every issue must have the `bug` or `enhancement` tag
* Every `bug` issue must have an `AUTHORITY:` tag. For example `AUTHORITY:VDOT` or `AUTHORITY:APCO` (just make your best guess)
  * The [VDOT Maintenance Responsibility Map](https://vdot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=c557bfd8c83e4ff4a93699ddf3c956b8) may be useful
* If the issue can be fixed by any citizen without dressing up as a public works employee to dispel suspicion, add the `DIYABLE` tag.
* After a bug has been submitted to the relevant authority, add the `REPORTED` tag and comment with a copy of the report/request you submitted to the authority
* If this issue is temporary, like an obstruction of a sidewalk, bike lane, or motor vehicle lane, **DO NOT** add an issue to this tracker. Instead call the Lynchburg Police Department non-emergency line at [+1 434 847 1602](tel:+14348471602) and report the issue. If a bike lane is obstructed, additionally submit information about the obstruction to [Bike Lane Uprising](https://www.bikelaneuprising.com/) or email [urban.lynchburg.xyz@nathanwyand.com](mailto:urban.lynchburg.xyz@nathanwyand.com) with as much detail as possible.

To submit an issue, sign up for a Github account or email [urban.lynchburg.xyz@nathanwyand.com](mailto:urban.lynchburg.xyz@nathanwyand.com) with as much detail as possible.
